        <li><strong>Onion and garlic:</strong> An onion and two cloves of garlic are added to the meat to add a nice flavor</li>
        <li><strong>Tomato products:</strong> We are going to be using a can of cushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce and at last, two cans of tomato paste</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> Two tablespoons of white sugar, to add subtle sweetness to the flavour of the sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong> Fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, italian seasoning, fennel seeds and black pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Lasagna noodles:</strong> We can use a pre-made store bought lasagna noodle, or we can use our own homemade. </li>
        <li><strong>Cheeses:</strong> A mix of Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese will make this lasagna extra indulging.  </li>
        <li><strong>Egg: </strong>An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it. </li>
